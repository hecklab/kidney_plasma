# plasma concentration conversion
The script was used in the data analysis of the described paper below. It uses the report.gg_matrix.tsv file from DIA-NN as an input file to convert the MaxLFQ values to g/ml concentrations. It's based on a linear regression model with 22 known reported average values of proteins in serum (A2M, B2M, C1R, C2, C6, C9, CFP, CP, F10, F12, F2, F7, F8, F9, HP, KLKB1, MB, MBL2, SERPINA1, TFRC, TTR, and VWF) extracted from *Schenk, S. et al. A high confidence, manually validated human blood plasma protein reference set. BMC Med Genomics 1, 41 (2008). https://doi.org/10.1186/1755-8794-1-41*
